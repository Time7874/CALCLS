# CALCLS

The code starts with a tag.


This tells the browser that this document is encoded in UTF-8, which is an 8-bit character encoding system.
 The next line of code starts with a
 This tells the browser that IE should use its own rendering engine for compatibility purposes.
 Next comes a meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0".
 This tells the browser to set its viewport width to be as wide as possible and scale it down by 1% so that it can fit on any device without scaling issues.
 It also sets the initial zoom level at 100%.
 The code is a demonstration of how to create a button with the cursor set to pointer.
 The code above would be used in conjunction with the style sheet file "style2.css" which can be found in the same directory as this HTML document.
 The code above is a CSS code that creates a container with two columns.
 The first column has the background color yellowgreen and the second column has the background color transparent.
 There are radial gradients on both columns, but they have different colors.
 The first gradient starts at 47% 33% of the width and goes to 0%, while the second gradient starts at 82% 65% of the width and goes to 0%.
 The container is positioned relative to its parent element (the div) so it can be moved around in relation to other elements inside it.
 It also has an 80vh height because this will allow for more content inside it without having any problems with scrollbars appearing or disappearing when scrolling down through long pages.
 The code is the result of a flex container with a width of 450px and a height of 80vh.
 The background-color:yellowgreen; background-image: radial-gradient(at 47% 33%, hsl(162.00, 77%, 40%) 0, transparent 59%), radial-gradient(at 82% 65%, hsl(219.31, 66%, 43%) 0, transparent 55%); display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: space-between; transition: all .5s; }
 The code starts with a container div.
 This is the main element that will contain all of the other elements in this page.
 The code then creates two more containers, one for the background and one for the text color.
 These are positioned absolutely so they sit on top of everything else on the page.
 Next, it creates a toggler which sits at 3% from the left side and 5% from top of its parent container (the container div).
 The toggler has a background image that matches up with what's behind it (in this case, white) and uses padding to give it some space around itself.
 It also sets its width and height based off how big you want your toggle button to be when clicked on by users.
 Finally, there is an equation inside of our toggle button which displays equations as well as their solutions when clicked on by users
 The code is an example of how to create a tooltip with the CSS3 property.
 The code above has been broken down into three sections: 1) The HTML5 doctype; 2) The CSS3 properties that are being used; and 3) The JavaScript function that will be executed when the tooltip is triggered.
 In the first section, you can see the HTML5 doctype at the beginning of the snippet.
 This tells web browsers that this page is written in HTML5 instead of XHTML or XML.
 You can also see that there are two CSS3 properties being used in this snippet: background-color and border-radius .
 These two properties are both being defined as variables ( --container-bg and var
 The code starts with a
